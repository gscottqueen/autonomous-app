      "Description": "A Google Lexus-model autonomous vehicle (“Google AV”) was traveling in autonomous mode eastbound on El
Camino Real in Mountain View in the far right-hand lane approaching the Castro St. intersection. As the Google AV
approached the intersection, it signaled its intent to make a right turn on red onto Castro St. The Google AV then
moved to the right-hand side of the lane to pass traffic in the same lane that was stopped at the intersection and
proceeding straight. However, the Google AV had to come to a stop and go around sandbags positioned around a
storm drain that were blocking its path. When the light turned green, traffic in the lane continued past the Google
AV. After a few cars had passed, the Google AV began to proceed back into the center of the lane to pass the sand
bags. A public transit bus was approaching from behind. The Google AV test driver saw the bus approaching in the
left side mirror but believed the bus would stop or slow to allow the Google AV to continue. Approximately three
seconds later, as the Google AV was reentering the center of the lane it made contact with the side of the bus. The
Google AV was operating in autonomous mode and traveling at less than 2 mph, and the bus was travelling at
about 15 mph at the time of contact.The Google AV sustained body damage to the left front fender, the left front wheel and one of its driver’s-side
sensors. There were no injuries reported at the scene."
